University of Canterbury LaTeX and LyX styles

To install uocthesis:

1) copy uocthesis.cls to the appropriate LaTeX folder, e.g. under Ubuntu, copy it to: /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex
2) run "texhash" from the command line
3) copy uocthesis.layout to the appropriate LyX folder, e.g. under Ubuntu, copy it to: /usr/share/lyx/layouts
4) Reconfigure LyX by going to Tools > Reconfigure

In LyX, the uocthesis style should now be available as a new document class.

Make sure the UClogo files (eps + pdf) are in the same folder as your document.

5) Open the example-thesis.lyx file, and replace the fields with your text to write your thesis.

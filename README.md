Installation
------------


Install Lyx: www.lyx.org (maybe you'll need to install separately LaTeX, maybe LyX will include everything).



To install it:

1. copy ```tauthesis.cls``` to the appropriate LaTeX folder, e.g. under Ubuntu, copy it to: /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex
2. run "texhash" from the command line
3. copy ```tauthesis.layout``` to the appropriate LyX folder, e.g. under Ubuntu, copy it to: /usr/share/lyx/layouts
4. Reconfigure LyX by going to Tools > Reconfigure
  *   In LyX, the tauthesis style should now be available as a new document class.
  *   Make sure the TAU logo files (eps + pdf + png) are in the same folder as your document.
5. Open the Thesis-main.lyx file, and replace the fields with your text to write your thesis.

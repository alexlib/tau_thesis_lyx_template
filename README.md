Download 
---------

The single compressed Zip file:

https://github.com/alexlib/tau_thesis_lyx_template/zipball/master

or using Git:

        git clone git@github.com:alexlib/tau_thesis_lyx_template.git


Installation
------------


Install Lyx: www.lyx.org (maybe you'll need to install separately LaTeX, maybe LyX will include everything).

No installation is required for the package, the directory is self-contained. 
The LyX file ```Thesis-main.lyx``` uses report class as the default and the specific commands are listed in the ```tauthesis.sty```

Open the ```Thesis-main.lyx``` file, and follow the instructions in the comments to replace the fields with your text. Most of the stuff is in ```Document -> Settings -> Latex preamble```

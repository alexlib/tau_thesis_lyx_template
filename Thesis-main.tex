This is Micheal JasonSmith's uocthesis example ported to \LyX{} by
Etienne Laliberté (etiennlaliberte@gmail.com).

Alex Liberzon (alex.liberzon@gmail.com) modified it to the Tel Aviv
University format, with the header of the Faculty of Engineering.
You can open the tauthesis.sty to update it to your needs.

Go to \textsf{Document > Settings > \LaTeX{} preamble} to modify the
\textsf{Title, Author, Year, Supervisor, Department} fields.

Default processor is now PDFLATEX.

Split the thesis into separate chapters. Use \textbackslash{}include
mode to include the separate files.

Use \LyX{} Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables and
Nomenclature automatics to include them in the thesis. Double - click
on each item to change the default level of contents, move the chapters
up/down and so on.

Want to add one more chapter, just copy paste the file introduction.lyx
into the new\_chapter.lyx or anything like that and copy-paste the
above line with Include: Introduction.lyx and change the name to new\_chapter.lyx.
All the format and proper numbering of figures, tables, etc. will
be automaticaly updated. Just start typing the text :)

It is possible to create the Hebrew part in \LyX{}, but this is less
of our concern. Any typesetting software like \LyX{} (or Word or OpenOffice)
is as good for this purpose. After creating the PDF file from the
Hebrew document, include it here using the Insert -> File -> External
material -> PDFpages (one of the options). See the example below.

This is Micheal JasonSmith's uocthesis example ported to \LyX{} by
Etienne Lalibertï¿½ (etiennlaliberte@gmail.com).

Alex Liberzon (alex.liberzon@gmail.com) modified it to the Tel Aviv
University format, with the logo of the Faculty of Engineering. Change
the file taulogo.png to get the logo of your department.

Go to \textsf{Document > Settings > \LaTeX{} preamble} to modify the
\textsf{Title, Author, Year, Supervisor, Department} fields.

Default processor is now DVIPDFM - but if you can choose something
else, try PDFLATEX and XELATEX - sometimes these are a bit faster.

Split the thesis into separate chapters. Use \textbackslash{}include
mode to include the separate files.

Use \LyX{} Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables and
Nomenclature automatics to include them in the thesis. Double - click
on each item to change the default level of contents, move the chapters
up/down and so on.

\begin{comment}
It is possible to create the Hebrew part in \LyX{}, but this is less
of our concern. Any typesetting software like \LyX{} (or Word or OpenOffice)
is as good for this purpose. After creating the PDF file from the
Hebrew document, include it here using the Insert -> File -> External
material -> PDFpages (one of the options). See the example below.
